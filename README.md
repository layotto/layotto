# Layotto (L8):To be the next layer of OSI layer 7
[查看中文版本](README-ZH.md)

Layotto is an application runtime developed using Golang, which provides various distributed capabilities for applications, such as state management, configuration management, and event-driven capabilities to simplify application development.

Layotto uses the open source [MOSN](https://github.com/mosn/mosn) as the base, in addition to providing distributed capabilities, it also provides Service Mesh's ability to control traffic.

## Features

- Hijacking and observation of data traffic
- The current limiting capability of the service
- Configuration center read and write monitoring capabilities

## Project Architecture

As shown in the architecture diagram below, Layotto uses the open source MOSN as the base to provide network layer management capabilities while providing distributed capabilities. The business logic can directly interact with Layotto through a lightweight SDK without paying attention to the specific back-end infrastructure.

Layotto provides sdk in various languages. The sdk interacts with Layotto through grpc. Application developers only need to specify their own infrastructure type through the configuration file [configure file](./configs/runtime_config.json) provided by Layotto. No coding changes are required, which greatly improves the portability of the program.
