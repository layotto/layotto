# Configuration API demo with apollo
This example shows how to add, delete, modify, and watch the [apollo configuration center](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo) through Layotto.

The architecture of this example is shown in the figure below. The processes started are: client APP, Layotto, Apollo server

### Deploy apollo and modify Layotto's config (optional)

You can skip this step, you don't need to deploy the apollo server yourself to use this demo. This demo will use the demo environment provided by [apollo official](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo): http://106.54.227.205/

If you have deployed apollo yourself, you can modify Layotto's config file (e.g. configs/config_apollo.json in the project) to change the apollo server address to your own.

### Run Layotto server

Download the project code to the local:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mosn/layotto.git
```

Switch the code directory and compile:

```bash
cd ${projectpath}/cmd/layotto
go build
```

After success, a new layotto file will be generated in the directory. Let's run it:

```bash
./layotto start -c ../../configs/config_apollo.json
```

### Run the client demo 

The client demo calls Layotto to add, delete, modify, and query configuration

```bash
 cd ${projectpath}/demo/configuration/apollo
 go build -o apolloClientDemo
 ./apolloClientDemo
```

If the following information is printed, the call is successfulï¼š

```bash
save key success
get configuration after save, &{Key:key1 Content:value1 Group:application Label:prod Tags:map[feature:print release:1.0.0] Metadata:map[]} 
get configuration after save, &{Key:haha Content:heihei Group:application Label:prod Tags:map[feature:haha release:1.0.0] Metadata:map[]} 
delete keys success
write start
receive subscribe resp store_name:"apollo" app_id:"apollo" items:<key:"heihei" content:"heihei1" group:"application" label:"prod" tags:<key:"feature" value:"haha" > tags:<key:"release" value:"16" > >
```

### Next step

The client demo uses the golang version SDK provided by Layotto. The SDK is located in the `sdk` directory. Users can directly call the APIs provided by Layotto through the corresponding SDK.

Besides the SDK,you can also call Layotto server directly using grpc,which makes it easy for different language to interact with Layotto.
