Layotto (/leÉªËˆÉ’tÉ™ÊŠ/) is an application runtime developed with Golang designed to help developers quickly build cloud-native applications that decouple applications from infrastructure. It provides various distributed capabilities for applications, such as state management, configuration management, and event publishing and subscribing, to simplify application development.

Based on the open source [MOSN](https://github.com/mosn/mosn), Layotto provides Service Mesh with the ability to manage and control traffic in addition to distributed capabilities.

## Birth Background

Layotto wants to be able to use [Multi-Runtime](https://www.infoq.com/articles/multi-runtime-microservice-architecture/) with Service
Whether you're using MOSN or Envoy or something else as the data plane of a Service Mesh, you can use Layotto to append runtimes to those data planes without adding new sidecars.

For example, by adding runtime capabilities to MOSNs, a Layotto process can [act as both the data side of istio] (en/start/istio/) and provide various runtime APIs (e.g., Configuration API, Pub/Sub API, etc.)

In addition, as we explored and practiced, we found that sidecars can do much more than that. With the introduction of WebAssembly(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly), we are trying to make Layotto a runtime container for FaaS (Function as a service).

If you are interested in the background of the birth, you can take a look at [this speech] (https://mosn.io/layotto/#/zh/blog/mosn-subproject-layotto-opening-a-new-chapter-in-service-grid-application-runtime/index)
ã€‚

## Features

- Service Communications
-wearService governance, such as traffic hijacking and observation, service throttling, etc
- [as istio's data plane](en/start/istio/)
- Configuration management
- State management
- Event publishing and subscribing
- Health checks and runtime metadata queries
- WASM-based multilingual programming

## Engineering Architecture

As shown in the architecture diagram shown in the figure below, Layotto uses open-source MOSN as the base, providing network layer management capabilities and distributed capabilities at the same time, and businesses can directly interact with Layotto through lightweight SDKs without paying attention to the specific infrastructure of the backend.

Layotto provides multiple language versions of the SDK that interact with Layotto via gRPC.

If you want to deploy your application to a different cloud platform (for example, deploy an application on Alibaba Cloud to AWS), you only need to configure the file provided by Layotto https://github.com/mosn/layotto/blob/main/configs/runtime_config.json.
, modify the configuration and specify the type of infrastructure you want to use, and you can make the application have the ability of "cross-cloud deployment" without modifying the application code, which greatly improves the portability of the program.

## FAQ

### What's the difference with DAPR?

dapr is an excellent runtime product, but it lacks the capabilities of Service Mesh, which is essential for actual implementation in the production environment, so we hope to combine the two capabilities of Runtime and Service Mesh to meet more complex production implementation needs.
