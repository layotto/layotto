## Overview

The purpose of this document is to analyze the implementation of the interface flow

## Prerequisite：

Document content refers to the following version of the code

### Code in： [flowcontrol代码](https://github.com/mosn/mosn/tree/master/pkg/filter/stream/flowcontrol)

### stream_filter_factory.go analysis

This class is a factory class to create StreamFilter.

Some constant values are defined for default values

Defines the restricted stream config class to load yaml definition and parse production corresponding functions

init() Inner initialization is the storage of name and corresponding constructor to the filter blocking plant map

Before looking at streamfilter, we see how factory classes are producing restricted streamers

Limit the streaming to the restricted stream chain structure to take effect in sequential order.

CreateFilterChain method adds multiple filters to the link structure

We can see that this interface is achieved by a wide variety of plant types, including those that we are studying today.

### Stream_filter.go Analysis

## Overall process：

Finally, we look back at the overall process progress:

1. Starting from the initialization function of stream_filter_factory.go, the program inserted createRpcFlowControlFilterFactory.

2. Mosn created a filter chain (code position[factory.go](https://github.com/mosn/mosn/tree/master/pkg/streamfilter/factory.go)) by circulating CreateFilterChain to include all filters in the chain structure, including our master restricted streaming today.

3. Create Limiter NewStreamFilter().

4. OnReceive() and eventually by sentinel (whether the threshold has been reached, whether to release traffic or stop traffic, StreamFilterStop or StreamFilterContinue).
