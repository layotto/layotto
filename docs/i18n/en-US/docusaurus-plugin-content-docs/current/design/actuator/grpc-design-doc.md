# MOSN gRPC framework design document

## Background

MOSN is able to provide a GRPC Server based on the go grpc server framework. Compared to the original go grpc server framework, the following capacity： is available

- Full reuse of MOSN Sidecar deployments, upgrades, shipping capabilities
- Reuse basic：HotUps, Listener Filter, Network Filter, etc. common in MOSN
- StreamFilter extension capability in MOSN

## Idea

- MOSN's gRPC capacity is largely based on the achievement of core competencies in the official gRPC library and varies from gRPC Server developers
- Based on NetworkFilter

## Detailed Design

Split NetworkFilter Mechanisms & Processes

![networkfilter.png](../(/img/actuator/networkfilter.jpg)

- When configuring the resolution, complete the start of the gRPC Server and start providing the service with the Listener listener listener for MOSN
- A connection to a NetworkFilter object
  - InitializeFilterCallbacks and OnNewConnections are also the interfaces called when the connection is created. They are responsible for initializing connections
  - OnData is an interface called after data is received and is responsible for data transmission
- go gRPC Server library, one connection from Listener to 'listen' and then read and write, while Listener's listening and connection data have been processed in the MOSN framework, where a layer of treatment is required
  - Listener and Conn are interface. Once processed in the MOSN Filter, then get data to gRPC Server, do gRPC Server without knowledge
  - Implementing Listener's package when configuring parsing
  - Implementing Conn packages in InitializeReadFilterCallbacks
  - Transmit the packed Conn to the encapsulated Listener, triggering Listener.Accept
  - Send read data in OnData to encapsulated Conns, Trigger Conn.Read

- gRPC Server implementation
  - In implementing the gRPC Server using the official gRPC framework, the developer needs to generate a .pb.go file based on proto file, and a set of interfaces that meet the performance defined in the interface to register (Register) into the gRPC Server framework
  - MOSN gRPC NetworkFilter needs to provide a similar registration capability, allowing developers to focus only on gRPC Server for logic, and then register in MOSN framework enough

- The MOSN GRPC framework requires the developer to implement a function, which returns a grpc server that does not call the Serve method.The framework will use the custom Listener to call the Serve method to block data

```Go
func init() {
    mgrpc.RegisterServerHandler("mygrpc", MyFunc)
}
func MyFunc(_ json.RawMessage) *grpc.Server {
    s := grpc.NewServer()
    // pb 是.pb.go 所在的 package 路径
    // server 是开发者实现的 api 接口
    pb.RegisterGreeterServer(s, &server{})
    return s
}
```

- Example of intended configuration (layotto)

```json
{
	"servers":[
		{
			"default_log_path":"stdout",
			"default_log_level": "INFO",
			"listeners":[
				{
					"name":"grpc",
					"address": "0.0.0.0:34904",
					"bind_port": true,
