# Layotto object storage (OSS) and collection of API interface definitions and design

## Background

In order for layotto support object storage capability, an abstract interface of oss is required.Abstracts of interfaces need to satisfy the theoretical “portable” and to give the interface a clear terminology.

## Interface Design

The design of the entire interface will follow the following principle：

1. **Semantical, i.e. abstract interfaces have a clear semantic meaning.**
2. **Functional completeness, i.e. abstract interfaces need to satisfy different kinds of abilities as much as possible.**
3. **Maximum portability, i.e. abstract interfaces need to meet the transplantability requirement to the maximum extent possible.**

These principles are designed at a high and low level of priority.In order to meet the above requirements, there may be the following question：

1. The field is redundant, entry and exit may have fields corresponding to specific manufacturers.
2. Some of the interfaces may be supported only by some of the oss manufacturers, i.e. “maximum portability possible”.

## Configure Module Design

The fields of the original configuration module are abstract as shown below in：

```go
/OssMetadata wraps the configuration of loss implementation
type OssMetadata structure LO
	Endpoint string `json:`endpoint`
	AccessKeyID string`json:`accessKeyID``
	AccessKeySecret string `json:"accessKeySecret``
	Region string `json:"region"
}
```

EndPoint, AccessKeyID, AccessKeySecretariat and Regions are all of the concepts available to them and are not explained at length here.

## Interface Design

The definition of the interface is primarily divided into one of the main fields：

1. Generic interfaces are those that are similar to those supported by all of PutObject, GetObject and others.
2. Non-common interfaces are those that are only partially supported by the oss service.For example, ListParts interfaces, aws cannot support.

The design of the interface primarily refers to the aliyun and aws and the minio interface definitions.

### DeleteObject

Object delete interface, used as file deletion, is the most basic ability of the goss.For the definition of the interface please find the link or pb definition above.

### PutObjectTagging

Label an object as the most basic ability of oss.For the definition of the interface please find the link or pb definition above.

### DeleteObjectTagging

Removing the tag of an object is the most basic ability of the oss.For the definition of the interface please find the link or pb definition above.

### GetObjectTagging

Get the tag of the object, which is the most basic ability of the oss.For the definition of the interface please find the link or pb definition above.

### CopyObject

Duplicate an existing object, is the most basic ability of the mass.For the definition of the interface please find the link or pb definition above.

### DeleteObjects

Deleting multiple objects, is the most basic ability of the mass.For the definition of the interface please find the link or pb definition above.

### ListObjects

Query all objects below bucket, supporting pagination queries, is the most basic ability of the mass.For the definition of the interface please find the link or pb definition above.

### GetObjectCannedAcl

Reading the object's announced acl. Users can set an object's action to control the object's access. First issue is the first issue. The following question： needs to be considered when designing the interface.

1. Whether to allow users to set object's action by api.
2. Whether the announced acl is portable

For the first issue, Aliyun is allowed to specify an object's action when uploading and to modify the object dynamically at any time.

**Aliyun acl defines the following：**

As can be seen from the above list, the definition of acl is differentiated by different oss-manufacturers, but the concept of canned acl exists and therefore the interface belongs to an interface that does not guarantee portability,
this requires a judgement on the value of acl in the implementation of a specific component.For example, during the migration of users from Tencent to Aliyun
to assign ACls to public-read-write and return to Aliyun like “not supported acl”,
as long as it can be done to remind users that the interface does not fit the portable.

**Note: Layotto offers acl, but users need to be cautious about the use of acl, because differences in the service may lead to unanticipated results.**
